    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">
      Effective date: 31.12.2025
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how NovaApplications ("we", "us") collects and uses
      information when you use Cat Chase: Endless Run (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App is child-directed and intended for a general audience including kids.</li>
      <li>We do not use analytics.</li>
      <li>We show ads through Google AdMob. Ads are non-personalized.</li>
      <li>AdMob may collect the Android Advertising ID to serve and measure ads.</li>
      <li>We collect crash reports to improve stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The App itself does not require you to provide personal information such as name,
      email address, or phone number.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports. These reports may include
      device information (such as device model, OS version), app version, and crash logs.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      We use Google AdMob to show ads. Because the App can be used by kids, we request
      non-personalized ads only and mark the app as child-directed and under age of consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google AdMob may collect the Android Advertising ID to serve and measure ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      AdMob may collect limited device information required to serve and measure ads.
      You can learn more here:
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="consent">GDPR and Consent (EEA/UK/Switzerland)</h2>
    <p>
      If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you may be shown a consent prompt
      provided by Google to comply with GDPR. We only serve non-personalized ads.
    </p>
    <h3>Consent revocation</h3>
    <p>
      In regions where consent is required (EEA, UK, and Switzerland), you can review or revoke
      your consent at any time in the App using the Privacy/Shield button on the start screen,
      which opens Google's privacy options form.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      This App is designed for a general audience including children. We do not knowingly
      collect personal information from children. Ads are requested as non-personalized.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We share data only with service providers necessary to run the App:
      Google AdMob (ads) and Firebase Crashlytics (crash reporting).
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the
      effective date at the top of this page.
